# Shooter-game
A basic shooter game featuring multiple weapon types, pickups and powerups
The weapons are scatterd around the map and can be picked up by the players. Each weapon uses a different ammo type and comes with some ammo when you pick it up. Additional ammo can be found as pickups on the floor.
There are 2 power ups, a speed boost and a jump boost.
The pickups can also spawn as a healing red heart or blue shield. The heart fully restores the missing health of the player and the shield fills up the shield bar, equivalent to a second health bar.
