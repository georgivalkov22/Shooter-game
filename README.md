# Shooter-game
A basic shooter game featuring multiple weapon types, pickups and powerups
The weapons are scatterd around the map and can be picked up by the players. Each weapon uses a different ammo type and comes with some ammo when you pick it up. Additional ammo can be found as pickups on the floor.
There are 2 power ups, a speed boost and a jump boost.
The pickups can also spawn as a healing red heart or blue shield. The heart fully restores the missing health of the player and the shield fills up the shield bar, equivalent to a second health bar.



To test the demo you need steam installed and running on your machine. Then unzip the .rar archive after downloading it. After you have unzipped the archive open the Windows folder and run the "Blaster.exe" file. The current build of the game is made for windows only.
